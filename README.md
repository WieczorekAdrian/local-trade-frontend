# Local Trade - Frontend Client

This repository contains the client-side application for **"Local Trade"** – a modern, high-performance marketplace platform. The project is built with a focus on clean architecture, type safety, and professional media handling.

## Tech Stack

* **Core:** React (Vite), TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons)
* **Media UI:** `yet-another-react-lightbox` (Full-screen preview)
* **State Management:** React Context API (Global State)
* **HTTP Client:** Axios (with secure Interceptors)
* **Routing:** React Router DOM

## Key Features & Architecture

### 1. Robust Media Integration (S3 & MinIO)
The application implements a secure and optimized system for product image management.
* **Secure Delivery:** Uses temporary **Pre-signed URLs** generated by the backend to serve private S3/MinIO content.
* **Interactive Gallery:** A custom-built image slider with thumbnail navigation and full-screen **Lightbox** support for an enhanced buyer experience.

### 2. Secure Authentication Pattern
* **HttpOnly Cookie Auth:** Architected to handle user sessions via secure cookies rather than `localStorage`, significantly reducing the surface for XSS attacks.
* **Session Persistence:** Includes an automatic session verification hook that synchronizes the application state with the backend on every initialization.

### 3. Clean Architecture & Scalability
* **Separation of Concerns:** The codebase strictly separates business logic (found in `services/`) from UI components, following the Smart vs. Dumb component pattern.
* **Full Type Safety:** Comprehensive TypeScript implementation ensures that API responses and internal data structures are strictly typed, minimizing runtime exceptions.
* **Atomic UI Components:** Built using modern styling practices for a responsive and consistent user interface.

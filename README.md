![Playwright Tests](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/WieczorekAdrian/local-trade-frontend/playwright.yml?branch=main&label=E2E%20Tests&style=flat-square)

This repository contains the client-side application for **"Local Trade"** – a modern, high-performance marketplace platform. The project is built with a focus on clean architecture, type safety, and professional media handling.

## Tech Stack

* **Core:** React (Vite), TypeScript
* **UI Components:** shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons)
* **Forms & Validation:** React Hook Form + Zod (Type-safe schema validation)
* **Media UI:** yet-another-react-lightbox (Full-screen preview)
* **State Management:** React Context API (Global State)
* **HTTP Client:** Axios (with secure Interceptors)
* **Routing:** React Router DOM
* **Code Quality:** ESLint (Linting), Prettier (Automated Formatting)

## Key Features & Architecture

### 1. Robust Media Integration (S3 & MinIO)
The application implements a secure and optimized system for product image management.
* **Secure Delivery:** Uses temporary Pre-signed URLs generated by the backend to serve private S3/MinIO content.
* **Interactive Gallery:** A custom-built image slider with thumbnail navigation and full-screen Lightbox support for an enhanced buyer experience.

### 2. Secure Authentication Pattern
* **HttpOnly Cookie Auth:** Architected to handle user sessions via secure cookies rather than `localStorage`, significantly reducing the surface for XSS attacks.
* **Session Persistence:** Includes an automatic session verification hook that synchronizes the application state with the backend on every initialization.

### 3. Real-time Communication & Search
* **WebSocket Chat:** Implements bi-directional communication for real-time messaging between users.
* **Message History:** Features a persistent chat history, allowing users to view past conversations seamlessly.
* **Dynamic Discovery:** Advanced search functionality with category-specific filtering and optimized pagination.

### 4. User Ecosystem & Dashboard
* **Personalized Profile:** A dedicated user area for managing active listings and personal account settings.

### 5. Clean Architecture & Scalability
* **Separation of Concerns:** The codebase strictly separates business logic (found in `services/`) from UI components, following the Smart vs. Dumb component pattern.
* **Full-stack Type Safety:** Comprehensive TypeScript implementation combined with Zod schema validation ensures that API responses and user inputs are strictly typed.
* **Atomic UI Components:** Built using shadcn/ui for a responsive, accessible, and consistent user interface.

### 6. Code Quality & Consistency
* **Automated Formatting:** Integrated with **Prettier** to enforce a unified coding style across the entire project.
* **Static Analysis:** **ESLint** is configured to catch potential bugs early and maintain high standards for React and TypeScript code.

### 7. Enhanced User Experience (Optimistic UI)
* **Instant Feedback:** Implements Optimistic UI patterns for high-frequency actions like "Add to Favorites" and "Real-time Messaging".
* **State Rollback:** Features robust error handling that automatically reverts the UI state in case of server-side failures, ensuring data consistency.
